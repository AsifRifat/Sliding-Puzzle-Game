# Sliding-Puzzle-Game
*	Project Title: Sliding Puzzle Game
*	Project Overview: There will be two part of this puzzle game. One is number puzzle and another is alphabet puzzle. As the system is login based, user will have to login by putting name and password. Then user will select which one to play. After selecting a particular option, the selective game will automatically start a new game window.

*	Project Details: For number puzzle there will be given a n×n board with n^2-1 tiles (every tile has one number from 1 to n^2-1) and one empty space. The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match final configuration using the empty space. We can slide four sides (left, right, above and below) tiles into the empty space. The Goal is to arrange the numbers in ascending order from left to right. For example, if user enters 3 as a input :

Similarly, for alphabet puzzle the logic is same. But this time user won’t give any input. Alphabet from A to H will be given randomly 3x3 with 8 tiles. User will have to arrange the alphabets in order.
*	Inside The Project: This OOP based project will have single class for each portion. And it will be based on SWING
